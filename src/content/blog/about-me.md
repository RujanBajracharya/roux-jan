## Introduction

I am currently a full-time associate software at [Konnectcraft](https://konnectcraft.ca/), a BCU (Birmingham City University) undergrad student, and a speedcuber.

## About my speedcubing journey

I learned how to solve a Rubik's cube in 2019. When I first learned how to solve a Rubik's cube, I could solve it in 40-50 seconds. But I wanted to get faster and faster. So I started learning how to speed-solve it. I have been speedcubing ever since (with few breaks in between), and currently my official single solve time is [12.21 seconds](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2022BAJR01), and my ao5 (average of 5) solve time is [16.43 seconds](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2022BAJR01).

## About my software development journey

I first learned how to code in the first semester of uni, where I learned Python. While I initially joined uni to become a network engineer, I found myself more interested in coding. So in the 2nd semester of uni, I tried out a bunch of stuff with coding, from data analysis with Pandas, to machine learning, to web development with basic HTML and CSS. Experimenting with bunch of stuff like this made me realise that I was more interested in Web Development. So, I started learning JavaScript, and React through [Meta's courses on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer).

After learning JS and React for 6-9 months (throughout 3rd and 4th semesters of my uni), I landed an internship at [Konnectcraft](https://konnectcraft.ca/), where I used a stack of React, Next.js, Tailwind, Django, and Docker. I was able to learn a lot of things in this internship, and I got to know a lot of people. In May 2024, I was offered a full-time position at [Konnectcraft](https://konnectcraft.ca), where I am currently working. This, coincidentally aligned with the start of 5th semester of uni, which meant I have been studying and working at the same time.

## Hobbies and stuff

### Video games

I am not someone who plays a lot of video games, but there are a few games I enjoy playing from time to time. I like playing Minecraft with my friends on a server once every few months (The two-week phase). I also like playing nerdy games like Geoguessr (I play a free knock-off called 'Geotastic', but same thing I guess). I once ranked top 91 in the world in the "Highscore Hunt" game mode in geotastic, which is a bit of a flex. I also like playing FIFA 14 career mode from time to time.

### Music

When I was 12-13 years old, I found myself listening to a lot of EDM songs from artists like Avicii, Skrillex, etc. This type of music was very different from other songs I listened to, and I found myself enjoying it. I was very curious as to how those artists make those sounds. I knew the sound didn't come from a regular instrument like Piano or Guitar, so how do they make those sounds?

While browsing looking for some "remix" of a song on YouTube, I came across a video of a guy "remaking" a song. I was very intrigued, and decided to watch the video. I read a few comments on the video, and found that the guy was using a software called "FL Studio". I quickly searched for the software and downloaded a trial version of it. After fiddling around with the software, I found myself obsessed with it. So, like any 13 year old, I started to learn how to make EDM music in my bedroom.

My parents were not very supportive of my musical interests. This was mainly because I was making EDM, which my parents didn't understand. My parents always listened to old Bollywood songs, with a lot of acoustic sounds. They found it hard to understand EDM, and would always say "TF are these stupid sounds" when I was making music. It also didn't help that we only had one laptop at home (my dad's work laptop), which would be at his workplace for 6 days a week. This meant I could only make music once a week. It went on like this for a few years. I couldn't make music, and when I could, my parents didn't like it. Then the pandemic hit.

During the Covid-19 lockdown, my dad's work laptop was at home every day. This meant, I could make music (without them knowing ofc). I had the time of my life. I was able to make music, and I was able to share it on the internet. While my music weren't great, one of the remixes I made blew up on YouTube, and it peaked at 35k views. But, it was probably my least favourite song I made, so to "avoid bad publicity", I delete that song from YouTube. You can still find it on SoundCloud, where it has a few thousand listens. This was a very stupid decision I made impulsively, and I still regret it.

After the pandemic, I couldn't make music anymore and my music career got stale again. I finally got a new Macbook Air M1 in 2022 for uni, and I was excited to be able to make music again. However, since I faced a lot of adversities when I had the most passion for music, I didn't have the same passion this time around. It also didn't help that I had lost all of my projects, samples, presets and stuff I had previously made, and I started using a different Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called Logic X Pro. This meant I had to start from scratch again, and my old passion for music had died out.

I rarely make any music nowadays (one song per year), and I am really heartbroken that I couldn't turn this into a life-long career. It definitely didn't help that I couldn't pursue this passion when I was younger, and was the most passionate about it.

Not tryna be a sellout, but, if u want to listen to what I made, you can find my music in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rnkyv7iTG4U), [SoundCloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/SJwLi8spWeofj7do8), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5nuVlgHuIyzj2PisvrZB8v?si=M_74XeTQS8SsUDFRkdobGw).

> ðŸ“˜ Note:

> SoundCloud and Spotify only contain my old stuff, and YouTube contains my new stuff.
